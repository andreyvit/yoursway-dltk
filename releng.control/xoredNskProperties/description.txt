The files in this directory are not used 
in production builds. 

They are given here as examples of how someone might
override various build properties on their own machine, 
to do "local builds".  

These files, if used, should be in the directory named in 
the LOCAL_BUILD_PROPERTIES_DIR environment variable, which 
is set in the "commonVariations" file.
