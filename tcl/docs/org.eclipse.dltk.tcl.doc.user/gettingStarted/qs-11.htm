<h1> Searching the workbench </h1>
<p> In this section, you will search the workbench for Tcl elements. </p>
<p> In the Search dialog, you can perform file, text or Tcl searches. Tcl searches 
  operate on the structure of the code. File searches operate on the files 
  by name and/or text content. Tcl searches are faster, since there is an
underlying indexing structure for the code structure.  Text searches allow
you to find matches inside comments and strings. 
</p>
<h2> Performing a Tcl search from the workbench </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the contents of the http.tcl file (from http1.0 standard package) and paste it to a new Tcl file in an exemplary project.</li>
  <li> In the Tcl perspective, click the <strong>Search</strong> 
    (<img src="images/search.png" alt="Search">) button 
    in the workbench toolbar or use <strong>Search &gt; Tcl</strong> from
    the menu bar. </li>
  <li> If it is not already selected, select the <strong>Tcl Search</strong> 
    tab. </li>
  <li> In the <strong>Search string</strong> field, type <em>http_config</em>. 
    In the <em>Search For</em> area, select <strong>Method</strong>, and in the <em>Limit 
    To</em> area, select <strong>Declaration</strong>.<br>
    Verify that the Scope is set to <strong>Workspace</strong>. 
    <p> <img src="images/tcl-search-1.png"  alt="Java Search dialog"> 
    </p>
    Then click <strong>Search</strong>. While searching you may click <strong>Cancel</strong> 
    at any time to stop the search. Partial results will be shown. </li>
  <li> In the Tcl perspective, the Search view shows the search results and the first match is
  	highlighted in the editor.

    </p>
    You may the <strong>Show Next Match</strong> 
    (<img src="images/search_next.png" alt="Show Next Match">) and <strong>Show Previous 
    Match</strong> (<img src="images/search_prev.png" alt="Show Previous Match">) buttons to navigate to each match
    (in this example there is a single match).<br>
    Note that if the file in which a match was found is not currently open, it is opened in an editor 
    when you select the match in the Search view.
  </li>
  <li> When you navigate to a search match using the Search view buttons, 
    the file opens in the editor at the position of the match. Search matches 
    are tagged with a search marker in the vertical ruler as on the screenshot above. 
  </li>
</ol>

  <li> In the Tcl perspective, click the&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong> button 
    in the workbench toolbar or select <strong>Search &gt; File</strong> from the menu bar. </li>

    tab.</li>
  <li> In the <strong>Containing text</strong> field, type <em>http_config</em>.
    Make sure that the <strong>File name patterns</strong>  field is set 
    to <em>*</em>. The Scope should be set to <em>Workspace</em>.

    Text field empty. </li>
</ol>
<h2> Viewing previous search results </h2>

  Search Results</strong> toolbar button to see a menu containing the list of the most 
  recent searches. You can choose items from this menu to view previous
searches.&nbsp; The list can be cleared by choosing <strong>Clear History</strong>. 
</p>
<img src="images/tcl-search-hist.png"  alt="Previous search results menu"> 
<p> 
The <strong>Previous Search Results</strong> button will display a dialog 
  with the list of all previous searches from the current session.
