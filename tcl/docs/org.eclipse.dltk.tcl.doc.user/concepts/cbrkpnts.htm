    <h1>Breakpoints</h1>
    <p>A breakpoint suspends the execution of a program at the location where the breakpoint is set.</p>

    <p>Breakpoints can be enabled and disabled via the context menu in the <strong>Breakpoints View</strong>, or via the context menu in the <strong><a href="../concepts/concepts-7.htm">Tcl Editor</a></strong> ruler.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An enabled breakpoint causes a thread to suspend whenever
        the breakpoint is encountered. Enabled breakpoints are drawn with a blue circle [ <img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/obj16/brkp_obj.png" alt="Breakpoint"> ] and
        have a checkmark overlay once successfully installed.
      </li>

      <li>A disabled breakpoint will not cause threads to suspend. Disabled breakpoints are drawn with a white circle [ <img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/obj16/brkpd_obj.png" alt="Disabled Breakpoint"> ].</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Breakpoints are displayed in the vertical editor ruler and in the Breakpoints view.</p>
