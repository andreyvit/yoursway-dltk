    <h1>Exclusion and inclusion filters</h1>

    <p>Exclusion and inclusion filters are Ant file patterns that further define 
    the set of source files to be considered by the Tcl builder and 
    other tools. To allow nesting of source folders inside each other, 
    or simply to exclude parts of a source tree, one can associate exclusion 
    filters to a source folder. Symmetrically inclusion filters can be used to include
    another part of a source tree. The Tcl builder will ignore source files
    that are excluded, and the ones that are not included.
