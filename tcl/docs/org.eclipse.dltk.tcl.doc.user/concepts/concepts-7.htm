    <h1>Tcl editor</h1>

    <p>The Tcl editor provides specialized features for editing Tcl code.</p>

    <p>Associated with the editor is a Tcl-specific Outline view, which shows the structure of the active Tcl compilation unit.
    It is updated as the user edits the compilation unit.</p>

    <p>The editor includes the following features:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Syntax highlighting</li>

      <li>Content/code assist</li>

      <!-- ??? <li>Import assistance</li> -->
      
      <!-- ??? <li>Quick fix</li> -->

      <li>Debugging features</li>
    </ul>

    <!--<p>The Tcl editor can be configured to either show an entire compilation unit or a single Tcl element only.
    To change the setting, use the toolbar button <b>Show Source of Selected Element Only</b>.
    </p> -->

    <p>The most common way to invoke the Tcl editor is to open a Tcl file from the
    Script explorer using pop-up menus or by clicking the file
    (single or double-click depending on the user preferences). You can
    also open the editor by opening Tcl elements, such as types, methods, or
    fields, from other views.</p>
