    <h1>Tcl search</h1>

    <p><span>The Tcl searching support allows you to find declarations, references and occurrences of Tcl elements
    (packages, types, methods, fields). Searching is supported by an index that
    is kept up to date in the background as the resources corresponding to Tcl elements are changed.
    The Tcl search operates on workspaces independent of their build state. For
    example, searches can be conducted when auto-build is turned off.</span></p>

    <p>The following searches can be initiated from the pop-up menus of Tcl elements:</p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" summary="Tcl search actions">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><span class="control">Command</span></p>
          </td>

          <td>
            <p><span class="control">Description</span></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <p>References</p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">
            <p>Finds all references to the selected Tcl element</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <p>Declarations</p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">
            <p>Finds all declarations of the selected Tcl element</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The scope of the search is defined as:</p>

    <p><span class="control">Workspace</span> - all projects and files in the workspace are included in this search</p>

    <p><span class="control">Working Set</span> - only resources that belong to the chosen working set are included in this search</p>
