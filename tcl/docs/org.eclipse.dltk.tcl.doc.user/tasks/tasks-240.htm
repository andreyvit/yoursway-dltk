    <h1>
      Creating refactoring scripts
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select <strong>Refactor</strong> &gt; <strong>Create Script...</strong> from the refactoring menu to show the create refactoring script dialog.
      </li>
      <li>
        The create refactoring script dialog displays the refactoring history of your workspace. Drill down to an individual refactoring and select
        it to see more details about the performed refactoring in the details view below.
      </li>
      <li>
      Refactoring scripts can either be copied to the clipboard or saved to a file in your local file system. Select <strong>Clipboard</strong> to copy the created
      refactoring script to the clipboard, or <strong>File</strong> to store the script to a file. Click on <strong>Browse...</strong> to select the
      location where to store the refactoring script.
      </li>
      <li>
      Select all refactorings that you would like to save into a refactoring script. Select years, months, weeks or days to select all associated refactorings at once. Select
      a project to save all refactorings associated with the project to a refactoring script.
      </li>
            <li>
      In order to be able to better select refactorings from the refactoring history, there are two ways to group your refactorings:<br>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Group by Project</strong>: Refactorings are grouped by project. Every refactoring is associated with the project that contains the element
      which served as input to the recorded refactoring. <br><strong>Note</strong>: There are certain instances of refactorings which cannot
      be uniquely associated with a project. These refactorings are associated with the entire workspace.
      </li>
            <li>
      <strong>Group by Date</strong>: Refactorings are grouped by date. The refactoring history dialog presents the refactorings as a history, last recently executed
      refactorings first.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      Click <strong>Create</strong> to create the refactoring script and close the dialog.
      </li>
    </ol>
