    <h1>
      Refactoring
    </h1>
    <p>
      The goal of refactoring support is to allow for improving your code without changing its behavior. When you refactor your code, your goal is to make a system-wide coding
      change without affecting the semantic behavior of the system. The JDT automatically manages refactorings for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refactorings which change method signatures allow to keep the original method to preserve not only the semantic of your code, but also the
      interfaces. This allows you to change methods in API types without breaking your clients. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The workbench optionally allows you to preview all the impending results of a refactoring action before you finally choose to carry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refactoring commands are available from the context menus in many views and editors and the <a href="ref-menu-refactor.htm">Refactor menu</a> in the menu bar.
