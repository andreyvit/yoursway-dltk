    <h1>
      Automatic Processor Options
    </h1>
    <p>Annotation processor options are configured in the 
    <a href="ref-apt-config.htm">Annotation Processing preference dialog</a>.  Certain options 
    are automatically provided to processors using the Java 5 Mirror API; entering them in the Annotation Processing 
    preference dialog will have no effect, since the automatically provided values will 
    override any values set there.  The automatic options include the following:</p>
    <dl>
    	<dt><strong>-classpath</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    		The compiler classpath.  All entries are absolute paths, not workspace-relative.
    	</dd>
    	<dt><strong>-sourcepath</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    		The compiler source path.  All entries are absolute paths, not workspace-relative.
    	</dd>
    	<dt><strong>-d</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    		The absolute path of the compiler binary output directory, into which .class files are 
    		built.
    	</dd>
    	<dt><strong>-s</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    		The absolute path of the generated source directory, into which annotation processors 
    		will generate files.
    	</dd>
    	<dt><strong>-source</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    		The compiler -source option.  Typically a string such as &quot;5.0&quot;.
    	</dd>
    	<dt><strong>-target</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    		The compiler -target option.  Typically a string such as &quot;5.0&quot;.
    	</dd>
    	<dt><strong>phase</strong></dt>
    	<dd>
    	    The string <code>RECONCILE</code>, <code>BUILD</code>, or <code>OTHER</code>, depending
    	    on whether the processor has been called during editing, during a build, or outside the
    	    context of compilation, respectively. This option is only provided when running in the Eclipse IDE.
    	</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Except for <code>phase</code>, there are no automatically provided options for processors 
    using the Java 6 annotation processing API, because the JavaFileManager methods provide the same functionality.</p>
