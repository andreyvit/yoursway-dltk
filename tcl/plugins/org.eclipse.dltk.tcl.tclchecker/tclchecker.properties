badColorFormat_explanation=The command expects the string to specify a color value. The string can be any of the following forms:\n colorname\n #RGB\n #RRGGBB\n #RRRGGGBBB\n #RRRRGGGGBBBB\n colorname can be any of the valid textual names for a color defined in the server's color database file, such as "red" or "PeachPuff". If the color name is not a Tcl defined color, a warning is flagged stating that the color may not be portable across all platforms; see nonPortColor. The RGB characters represent hexadecimal digits that specify the red, green, and blue intensities of the color.

badCursor_type=Error
badCursor_explanation=The command expects the string to specify a cursor to use. The string can take any of the following forms:\n ""\n name \n name fgColor \n @sourceFile fgColor \n name fgColor bgColor\n @sourceFile maskFile fgColor bgColor\n If the name form is used, and the name of the cursor is not defined on all platforms, a warning is flagged stating that the cursor is not portable; see nonPortCursor. None of the forms that specify a color or multiple files are portable across all systems; they are flagged as being non-portable; nonPortCmd.

badFloat_type=Error
badFloat_explanation=The command expects the string to consist of a floating-point number, which is: white space; a sign; a sequence of digits; a decimal point; a sequence of digits; the letter "e"; and a signed decimal exponent. Any of the fields may be omitted, except that the digits either before or after the decimal point must be present and if the "e" is present then it must be followed by the exponent number.

badIndex_type=Error
badIndex_explanation=The command expects the string to specify an index value. The string can be an integer or "end".

badIndexExpr_type=Error
badIndexExpr_explanation=When reading an index, you must specify the exact integer position, or the position relative to the end of the index using the "end" or "end-index_number" strings.

badInt_type=Error
badInt_explanation=The command expects the string to specify an integer value. The string can be optionally signed and optionally preceded by white space. If the first two characters of the string are "0x" then string is expected to be in hexadecimal form; if the first character of string is "0" then the string is expected to be in octal form; otherwise, the string is expected to be in decimal form.

badKey_type=Error
badKey_explanation=The command expects the key string to be a key that matches one of the strings in the options list.

badLevel_type=Error
badLevel_explanation=The command expects the string to be an integer or a "#" character followed by an integer.

badList_type=Error
badList_explanation=The command expects the string to be a valid Tcl list. The reason the string is not a valid Tcl list is displayed in the message associated with the error.

badListLength_type=Error
badListLength_explanation=The command expects the string to be a valid Tcl list with a length n satisfying the condition "n % x == y". For example: "n % 2 == 0" is the condition for lists of even length.

badMathOp_type=Error
badMathOp_explanation=When working with mathematical expressions, you must use valid operators for the "expr" command. See "expr" in the Tcl Commands Manual section of the ActiveTcl User Guide.

badMode_type=Error

invalidUsage_type=Upgrade Error
invalidUsage_explanation=All functions internal to the Tk binding have been moved to the "Tk::" namespace and have been made private. In Tcl 8.4 mode, this error reports use of a command that is now invalid.

mismatchOptions_type=Error
mismatchOptions_explanation=Two or more options were specified that cannot be used at the same time. The command should be re-written to use only one of the switches. This commonly occurs when an overloaded command performs completely different operations based on the switches.

noExpr_type=Error
noExpr_explanation=Similar to the numArgs message. The Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker flags this error message when an expression is missing in an if statement.

nonDefAfterDef_type=Error
nonDefAfterDef_explanation=A non-defaulted argument has been specified after a defaulted argument in a procedure argument list. Although the Tcl interpreter does not complain about this usage, the default values are ignored.

nonPortChannel_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortChannel_explanation=A channel was specified that is not supported on all platforms. In most cases, this is when "file0", "file1", or "file2" is used instead of "stdin", "stdout", or "stderr".

nonPortCmd_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortCmd_explanation=A command was specified that is not supported on all platforms.

nonPortColor_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortColor_explanation=A color was specified that is not supported on all platforms.

nonPortCursor_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortCursor_explanation=A cursor was specified that is not supported on all platforms.

nonPortFile_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortFile_explanation=A file name was specified that is not supported on all platforms. This warning is flagged, then the string is a combination of words, variables, or commands separated by system-specific file separators (for example, "$dir\$file"). Use the file join command to add the system-specific file separators (for example, "[file join $dir $file]").

nonPortOption_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortOption_explanation=An option was specified that is not supported on all platforms. Generally, the option has no effect on the systems that do not support this option.

nonPortVar_type=Non-Portable Warning
nonPortVar_explanation=A variable was used that is not supported on all platforms. In most cases, this is when the tcl_precision variable is used.

nonPublicVar_type=Non-Public Warning
nonPublicVar_explanation=This error indicates that the program is trying to use the contents of the Tk::priv variable. This variable is internal and should not be used.

noScript_type=Error
noScript_explanation=Similar to the numArgs message. The Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker flags this error message when an expression is missing in an if statement.

noSwitchArg_type=Error
noSwitchArg_explanation=The command was called with a switch that expected an argument. If no argument was given for the switch, this error is flagged.

numArgs_type=Error
numArgs_explanation=An incorrect number of arguments were specified for a command. Due to the dynamic nature of Tcl, this error might be flagged unnecessarily. For example, if the command is called within an eval body with variables that will expand to be multiple arguments. The Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker sees only the one argument, but this may expand to match the required number of arguments when the command is evaluated.

numListElts_type=Error
numListElts_explanation=Some commands expect lists with a fixed number of elements. This error indicates that an incorrect number of elements has been specified. See the documentation for the specific command in the ActiveTcl User Guide.

obsoleteCmd_type=Error
obsoleteCmd_explanation=The specified command, option or variable does not exist and is no longer supported in the version of the system you are checking. Use the suggested alternative command, option, or variable to upgrade the script.

parse_type=Error
parse_explanation=The Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker could not parse the script completely due to a parsing error. The reason for the parsing error is displayed in the message associated with the error.

procNumArgs_type=Error
procNumArgs_explanation=You are using the wrong number of arguments to call the Tcl procedure procName . Compare the number of arguments used to call the procedure to the number of arguments in the definition of procName.

tooManyFieldArg_type=Error

warnExportPat_type=Warning Export
warnExportPat_explanation=Each export pattern can contain glob -style special characters, but it must not include any namespace qualifiers. That is, the pattern can only specify commands in the current (exporting) namespace.

warnExpr_type=Performance Warning
warnExpr_explanation=The expr command performs two levels of substitution on all expressions that are not inside curly braces. To avoid the second substitution, and to improve the performance of the command, place the expression inside curly braces. There are cases where the second level of substitution is required and this warning will not apply. The Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker does not discern between these cases.

warnExtraClose_type=Usage Warning
warnExtraClose_explanation=A close bracket or close brace without a matching open bracket or open brace was detected. This frequently indicates an error introduced when a subcommand or script is deleted without deleting the final close brace or bracket.

warnGlobalNsNonsense_type=Warning
warnGlobalNsNonsense_explanation=Using the global command within a namespace eval is an undefined operation.

warnGlobalVarColl_type=Warning
warnGlobalVarColl_explanation=When writing to the variable via set it is undetermined if a global or namespace variable is created.

warnIfKeyword_type=Warning
warnIfKeyword_explanation=When using the if command, it is legal to omit the else and elseif keywords. However, omission of these keywords tends to produce error-prone code; thus, a warning is flagged.

warnInternalCmd_type=Warning
warnInternalCmd_explanation=This message indicates that you are using commands internal to an extension. It is safer to use public APIs wherever possible.

warnNamespacePat_type=Warning
warnNamespacePat_explanation=Each namespace pattern is qualified with the name of an exporting namespace and may have glob -style special characters in the command name at the end of the qualified name. The warning is flagged if glob characters appears in a namespace name.

warnPattern_type=Warning
warnPattern_explanation=Glob patterns use brackets to specify a list of characters to match. If brackets are used and the word is not properly quoted, Tcl will interpret this as a subcommand to be evaluated, rather than a pattern. This warning is flagged to avoid possible usage errors of this nature.

warnReadonlyVar_type=Warning
warnReadonlyVar_explanation=The Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker is hard-coded to recognize certain variables as internal to Tcl/Tk. The value of these variables should not be changed. These variables include: tcl_platform (Tcl), tkPriv (Tk 8.3), tk::Priv (Tk 8.4)

warnRedefine_type=Usage Warning
warnRedefine_explanation=A procedure or class is being defined, imported, inherited, or renamed into a scope where a procedure or class of the same name already exists.

warnReserved_type=Upgrade
warnReserved_explanation=When checking scripts using older versions of Tcl, Tk or [incr Tcl], this warning is flagged if a command is used that does not exist in the systems that you are checking against, but does exist in later versions. This warning helps to prevent scripts from defining commands that will eventually collide with later versions.

warnShadowVar_type=Warning
warnShadowVar_explanation=This usage of the variable may hide or kill a previous definition of the same name.

warnUndefinedUpvar_type=Warning
warnUndefinedUpvar_explanation=The named procedure (in)directly calls the current scope, but is not defining the variable expected by the upvar.

warnUndefinedVar_type=Warning
warnUndefinedVar_explanation=The named variable is not known in the current scope.

warnUndefFunc_type=Warning
warnUndefFunc_explanation=The specified function is not defined as part of the "expr" command. See the "expr" command reference in the ActiveTcl User Guide for a list of valid functions.

warnUndefProc_type=Warning
warnUndefProc_explanation=The procedure was not defined in any of the files that were specified on the command line of the current invocation of the Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker. The procedure may get defined dynamically or in a file that was not specified on the Tcl Dev Kit TclChecker command line. This warning is triggered only for the first use of the undefined procedure in the files being checked.

warnUnsupported_type=Error
warnUnsupported_explanation=The specified command, option or variable still exists but is no longer supported. Use the suggested alternative command, option, or variable to upgrade the script.

warnUpvarNsNonsense_type=Error
warnUpvarNsNonsense_explanation=You cannot import procedure-local variables into a namespace scope.

warnVarRef_type=Warning
warnVarRef_explanation=Some commands expect a variable name for an argument, for example, incr . If the argument is a variable reference, this warning is flagged to report possible usage errors.

winAlpha_type=Error
winAlpha_explanation=The window name for any Tcl widget cannot begin with a capital letter.

coreTcl::warnEscapeChar_type=Upgrade Warning
coreTcl::warnEscapeChar_explanation=The new regular expression package introduced in Tcl 8.1 added many new special character sequences, called "escape characters." When upgrading to 8.1 or later, the escape characters will change the semantics of the expression. To maintain the behavior of previous versions of Tcl, add another backslash before the character. (This warning is displayed only if you specify the -use option with Tcl 8.0 or earlier.)

coreTcl::warnMemoryCmd_type=Warning
coreTcl::warnMemoryCmd_explanation=The "memory" command is only available when the core is compiled using the TCL_MEM_DEBUG mode.

coreTcl::warnNotSpecial_type=Upgrade Warning
coreTcl::warnNotSpecial_explanation=The backslash character is used to quote special characters in an expression so their literal value can be used. The character following the backslash in this expression has no affect on the character. Consider simplifying the expression.

coreTcl::warnQuoteChar_type=Upgrade Warning
coreTcl::warnQuoteChar_explanation=The new regular expression package introduced in Tcl 8.1 changed the semantics of the backslash character inside of bracket expressions. Previously they were treated as literal characters. Now they are treated as a quote character. To maintain the behavior of previous versions of Tcl, add another backslash before the existing backslash (for example, [*-\] becomes [*-\\]). (This warning is displayed only if you specify the -use option with Tcl 8.0 or earlier.)

coreTcl::warnY2K_type=Warning
coreTcl::warnY2K_explanation=To avoid possible Y2K errors, use the "%Y" field descriptor to generate years with centuries (for example, "1999" instead of "99").
