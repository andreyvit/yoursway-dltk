	// continuation command is optional, and the IDE should verify support for
	// it via the feature_get command. If the IDE has created
	// stdin/stdout/stderr pipes for execution of the script (eg. an interactive
	// shell or other console to catch script output), it should keep those open
	// and usable by the process until the process has terminated normally.
