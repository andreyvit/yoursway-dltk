<h2>Type inference(draft)</h2>

<p>DLTK has a language independent engine for building type inference systems. It uses demand-driven analysis with subgoal pruning algorithm. Key abstractions here:
<ul>
<li><em>Goal</em>. It may be type of some ASTNode in source file, incoming/outcoming data flow, whatever. Goals are unique. So, two object of IGoal having a common ASTNode object is equal.
<li><em>Goal evaluator</em>. Strategy, that knows how to evaluate goal. While evaluating it may produce another helper goals (sub-goals), may wait for their results and only after that produce it's own result.
<li><em>Goal evaluator factory</em>. This factory constructs a GoalEvaluator objects for given IGoals.
<li><em>Pruner</em>. Pruner is a straregy that are able to cancel some evaluators as non-important. Also using pruner is possible to implement time limits for evaluations. 
</ul>
