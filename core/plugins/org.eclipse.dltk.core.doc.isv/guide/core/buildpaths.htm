<h2>Build paths</h2>

<p>Similar to java class paths, DLTK has a concept of build paths.

<p>Build paths is a set of source folders, library containers and
references to another projects. This paths are used as for model
building, so for launching.

<p>Paths is stored in .buildpath file from project's root folder.
DLTK automatically parses it when required. You can get project build
paths via <code>IScriptProject.getRawBuildpath()</code> method. To set
buildpath to project you should use setRawBuildpath() method. Elements
of <code>IBuildpathEntry</code> may be created with <code>DLTKCore.new*Entry(...)</code>
methods.
