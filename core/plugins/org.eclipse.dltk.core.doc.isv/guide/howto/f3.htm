<h2>Go-to-the-declaration</h2>

<p>For go-to-the-declaration feature and many others like documentation hovers you need to implement selection engine. Task of selection engine is to determine model element from given offset in source file. 

<p>Selection engines could be contributed via org.eclipse.dltk.core.selectionEngine extension point, they should implement ISelectionEngine interface. DLTK already has partial implementation of this interface: ScriptSelectionEngine, so you could just extend it. 

<p>For example implementation, you can look at RubySelectionEngine.
